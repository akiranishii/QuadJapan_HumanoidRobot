# Humanoid Robot Value Chain

An interactive visualization tool for analyzing the global humanoid robotics industry ecosystem, mapping companies across the entire value chain from brain (AI/software) to body (hardware) to integrators (complete systems).

## üåü Features

### **Interactive World Map**
- **Geographic Visualization**: Companies plotted on a world map with market cap-sized bubbles
- **Company Consolidation**: Multiple product lines from the same company are intelligently combined
- **Smart Tooltips**: Hover over bubbles to see detailed company information
- **Category Color Coding**: Brain (red), Body (green), Integrator (yellow)

### **Advanced Filtering System**
- **Category Filter**: Brain, Body, Integrator, or All
- **Product Group Filter**: 19+ subcategories (AI & Software, Sensors/Electronics, etc.)
- **Country Multi-Select**: Compare specific countries or regions
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Filters work together to provide precise views

### **Matrix Table View**
- **Gap Analysis**: Easily spot countries with zero companies in specific areas
- **Country Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of robotics capabilities
- **Company Counts**: Number of companies per product group per country
- **Sorted by Impact**: Countries ordered by total company count

## üöÄ How to Use

### **Basic Navigation**
1. **Map View**: Default view showing companies as bubbles on world map
2. **Table View**: Click "Show Table" to switch to matrix comparison view
3. **Filters**: Use dropdowns to narrow down your analysis

### **Filtering Options**
- **Category**: Select Brain, Body, or Integrator to focus on specific value chain segments
- **Product Group**: Drill down to specific technologies (e.g., "AI & Software", "Energy & Power")
- **Countries**: Click countries multiple times to select/deselect for comparison

### **Finding Insights**
- **Market Gaps**: Look for "‚Äî" symbols in table view to find underserved markets
- **Competitive Landscape**: Compare country strengths across product categories
- **Market Size**: Bubble size indicates company market capitalization
- **Geographic Clusters**: Identify regional technology hubs

## üåê GitHub Pages Deployment

This project is configured to deploy to GitHub Pages automatically. The live site is available at:
**https://nssokada.github.io/QuadJapan_HumanoidRobot/**

### **Automatic Deployment (Recommended)**
The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically deploys when you push to the `main` branch:

1. **Push your changes** to the `main` branch
2. **GitHub Actions** will automatically:
   - Install dependencies
   - Build the project (creates `docs` folder)
   - Deploy to `gh-pages` branch
3. **Your site updates** within a few minutes

### **Manual Deployment**
If you prefer manual deployment:

```bash
# Build the project (creates docs folder)
npm run build

# The docs folder is ready for GitHub Pages
# Commit and push the docs folder to main branch
git add docs
git commit -m "Update build"
git push origin main
```

### **GitHub Pages Setup**
If setting up for the first time:

1. Go to your repository **Settings**
2. Navigate to **"Pages"** section  
3. Set **Source** to "Deploy from a branch"
4. Select **`gh-pages`** branch and **`/ (root)`** folder
5. Save settings
6. Your site will be live at the homepage URL in a few minutes

### **Local Testing**
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:3000`
